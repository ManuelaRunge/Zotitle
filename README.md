Zotitle
=================

Very simple zotero plugin to change title case of selected Zotero items into `UPPERCASE`, `lowercase`, `Sentence case` or `Title Case`.

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/ManuelaRunge/zotero-zotitle/releases/latest) (need to figure out how to make an initial release).

This is my first Zotero plugin. 
If you find any issues or have any comments or suggestions, please let me know!


**Forthcoming updates:** 
- add preferences to:
   - allow user-defined exceptions to upper and lower case changes
   - enable to keep country names capitalized per default
   - enable to keep propositions lowercase per default
- add new functionality to italicize user-defined scientific terms


**Change log:**
- August 2023: initial release for basic functionality
- August 2023: found this awesome zotero-plugin [zotero-citationcounts](https://github.com/eschnett/zotero-citationcounts/tree/master), that I used as a template and learning guide. 
- later in 2022: tried using [hello-world](https://github.com/zotero/zotero-hello-world) (not working for me) and [Zotfile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile) (amazing plugin but too complex for me). 
- January 2022: created intial plugin folder structure using the  [zotero plugin generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-zotero-plugin),
