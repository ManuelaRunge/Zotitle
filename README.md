Zotitle
=================

Very simple zotero plugin to change title case of selected Zotero items into `UPPERCASE`, `lowercase`, `Sentence case` or `Title Case`.

Install by downloading the [initial release v1.0.0](https://github.com/ManuelaRunge/Zotitle/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

This is my first Zotero plugin. 
If you find any issues or have any comments or suggestions, please let me know!


**Forthcoming updates:** 
- add preferences to:
   - allow user-defined exceptions to upper and lower case changes
   - enable to keep country names capitalized per default
   - enable to keep propositions lowercase per default
- add new functionality to italicize user-defined scientific terms


**Change log and credits:**
- August 2023: initial release for basic functionality
- August 2023: found this awesome zotero-plugin [eschnett/zotero-citationcounts](https://github.com/eschnett/zotero-citationcounts/tree/master), that I used as a template and learning guide.
- July 2023: found [dcartertod/zotero-plugins](https://github.com/dcartertod/zotero-plugins/tree/main) and borrowed temporarily `make-xpi.ps1`.
- later in 2022: tried using [hello-world](https://github.com/zotero/zotero-hello-world) (not working for me) and [Zotfile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile) (amazing plugin but too complex for me). 
- January 2022: created intial plugin folder structure using the  [zotero plugin generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-zotero-plugin),
