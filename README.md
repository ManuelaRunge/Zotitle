Zotitle
=================

Plugin to change capitalization and italicization of words in item title.

Install by downloading the [latest version](https://github.com/ManuelaRunge/zotero-zotitle/releases/latest) (coming soon).

Plugin folder structure was created using the `zotero plugin generator` at https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-zotero-plugin.
Plugin edits for customizing for own use were inspired from several plugins: [zotero-hello-world](https://github.com/zotero/zotero-hello-world), [ZoteroPreview](https://github.com/dcartertod/zotero-plugins/tree/main/ZoteroPreview), [zotfile](https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile).

This is my first Zotero plugin. If you find any issues or have any comments, please submit an issue report.

Planned updates: 
- allow adding common and user-defined exceptions
- add italicization of common and user-defined scientific terms
